While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (""Commercial Contributor"") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (""Indemnified Contributor"") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively ""Losses"") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.  The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</FONT>

-<P><FONT SIZE=""2"">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.  That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.  If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone.  Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</FONT>

+
+<p class=""list"">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
+
+<p class=""list"">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each
+copy of the Program.</p>
+
+<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained

+
+<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
+Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
+Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>
+
+<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>
+
+<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
+responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
+like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
+the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
+product offering should do so in a manner which does not create
+potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
+includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
+(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and
+indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)
+against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)
+arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third
+party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
+acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
+distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
+obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
+relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In
+order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
+the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
+Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
+Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
+Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
+expense.</p>
+
+<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
+product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
+Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
+claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
+claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
+alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
+defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
+performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
+Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
+must pay those damages.</p>
+
+<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>
+
+<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
+PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
+OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
+ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
+OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
+responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
+distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
+exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
+the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
+damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or
+interruption of operations.</p>
+
+<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>
+
+<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
+NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
+INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
+WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
+LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
+NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
+DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
+HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
+
+<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>
+
+<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
+applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
+the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
+by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
+extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
+
+<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
+(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
+Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
+software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
+Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the
+date such litigation is filed.</p>
+
+<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
+fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
+Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time
+after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights
+under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
+distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
+Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by
+Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
+
+<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
+Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
+copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
+Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including
+revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
+Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse
+Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
+assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a
+suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be
+given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
+Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
+Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
+of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
+Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
+expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no
+rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under
+this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
+otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
+Agreement are reserved.</p>
+
+<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
+the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party
+to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more
+than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its
+rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>
