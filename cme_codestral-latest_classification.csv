This is done to ensure the software meets the requirements of the users and to maintain the quality of the software over time. The added tests are for the okhttp-brotli, okhttp-dnsoverhttps, okhttp-logging-interceptor, and okhttp-sse projects, which are dependencies of the Android test project. The tests are also disabled for certain scenarios to handle cleartext requirements and logging levels."
