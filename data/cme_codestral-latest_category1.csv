https://api.github.com/repos/junit-team/junit4/commits/467c3f8efe1a87e3029df282e4df60ad98bc4142,Describe Issue,"The commit message explains the motivation for the code change by describing the issue with the current implementation. The issue is that the 'assertThat' method is used from JUnit's Assert class, but it is recommended to use Hamcrest's own 'assertThat' method directly. This is because Hamcrest is an independent assertion library and contains its own 'assertThat' method, which is available in both the old and current versions of Hamcrest. By deprecating JUnit's 'assertThat' method, the code is made more consistent and in line with the recommendations of the Hamcrest team."
